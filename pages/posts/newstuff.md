These last few months became a lot more turbulent than I care for so I took some time off from this blog. We are at the start of a new year and I have started to see my plans in a new frame. I have a bad habit of constantly wanting to do the new shiny thing so I had to reflect a healthy amount of time over these ideas to make sure I wasn’t falling victim to one of my own traps and am going to make sure to stick with this path and work it until it stops working or grows into something amazing.

I am writing this out here for a few reasons but the main reason is so I can keep track of my journey and use it as inspiration.The project will start to take off and when times get hard I want to look back on when it was just an idea and gain some wind at my back. I will definitely make sure the blog posts coming up give more information to help the readers I gotta do stuff for y’all too. 

So this big genius idea I have been going on about is *drum roll please* offering website and application development as a service. I know, I know this is ground breaking and revoloutionary and will change the tech landscape forever at this point I will go down in history right alongside Zuckerberg, Gates and Jobs. All jokes aside I have done jobs over the years but never made it my primary focus so I do have a lot of learning to do when it comes to doing this as a full time thing.

Building this service out is going to require setting up a website to promote my offerings, creating marketing funnels to gather customers and leads, creating templates for work processes and showing customers what to expect from products. There is definitely a lot more I can’t think of right now but as I get this more organized I will be able to create a list of all the great content you can expect to get from me soon on this topic. I am back and better then ever let’s get going!
