Hello is this thing on? My name is Okera Johnson I am a developer, dog lover, and dreamer who is working on actualizing my plans. So with that in mind I finally went ahead and launched this blog so I could talk about my adventures in the tech world. You can expect to read about programming, e-commerce, digital marketing, online business and other things in the digital world. I plan on doing a post a week as of now and will see how things go from here. Heres to new beginnings and hoping you find something in my writing that sticks with you.
